# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form for booking a table
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

-Add a page for suggesting new drink recipes and ideas
-Add a page for finding study buddies, or just meeting people
-Add a page detailing the Triple Peaks' events (chess club, drawing club, etc.)
-Add a script to the "Book a table" page to show which tables are already booked, or currently booked
-Get or make a nicer-looking custom font for the Menu (needs to stay easily-readable)
